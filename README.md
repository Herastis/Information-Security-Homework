# Information Security homework
Implement a communication infrastructure that uses the AES cryptosystem for encrypting traffic between two nodes A and B with the following characteristics:

1. Consider a KM node (key manager) that holds three 128-bit keys K1, K2 and K3. The K1 key is associated with the CBC operating mode. The K2 key is associated with OFB operating mode. K3 is used to encrypt keys K1 and K2. It is considered that the initialization vector has a fixed value known from the beginning both A and B. Also the key K3 is held from the start by A and B.

2. To initiate a secure communication session, node A sends a message to B in which it communicates the mode of operation (CBC or OFB), requesting at the same time the corresponding key owned by node KM . Required key (K1 or K2 depending on the operating mode) is generated by KM randomly, using a cryptographic library, and then encrypted as a single block with AES using the K3 key, then sends it to the node A. After A receives the encrypted key from KM, it will forward it to the node B. A and B will decrypt the key (K1 or K2) to start communication. Also node B will send to A a message to start the communication.

3. After receiving the confirmation message from B (regarding the start communication), A starts sending to B the contents of an encrypted file on blocks using the selected mode. Node B will decrypt the received blocks and display the result obtained.
